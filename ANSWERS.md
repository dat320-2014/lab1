##Exercises from the online Unix tutorial

###Exercise 1a

Make another directory inside the `unixstuff` directory called `backups`

**Answer:** *`mkdir backups`*

###Exercise 1b

Use the commands `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to explore the file system.

(Remember, if you get lost, type `cd` by itself to return to your home-directory)

**Answer:** *`cd leif; cd dev; pwd; ls -a;`*

###Exercise 2a

Create a backup of your `science.txt` file by copying it to a file called `science.bak`

**Answer:** *`cp /vol/examples/tutorial/science.txt /unixstuff/backups/science.bak`*

###Exercise 2b

Create a directory called `tempstuff` using `mkdir`, then remove it using the `rmdir` command.

**Answer:** *`mkdir tempstuff; rmdir tempstuff;`*

###Exercise 3a

Using the above method, create another file called `list2` containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of `list2`.

**Answer:** *`cat > list2
orange
plum
mango
grapefruit
^D;
cat list2`*

###Exercise 3b

Using pipes, display all lines of `list1` and `list2` containing the letter 'p', and sort the result.

**Answer:** *`cat list1 list2 | grep p | sort`*

###Exercise 5a

Try changing access permissions on the file `science.txt` and on the directory `backups`.

Use `ls -l` to check that the permissions have changed.

##The C Language and Make tool Questions

1. How do you use `gcc` to only produce the `.o` file?  What is the difference between generating only the `.o` file, and building the `hello` executable done in the previous compilation above?
  - **Answer:** *`gcc -g -O -c hello.c` *
1. Give the command for compiling with `debug` enabled instead of normal compilation for the two examples shown in Listing 2 and Listing 3. Explain how to turn debugging on/off for the two cases.
  - **Answer:** *
  Listing 2:
  By using the flag: `-g` and define debug`-DDEBUG`
  Listing 3:
  By setting `int debug = 1`
  *
1. Give a brief pros and cons discussion for the two methods to add debug code shown in Listing 2 and Listing 3.
  - **Answer:** *
  Listing2:
  Pros: Debug options automaticly set at compile Cons: Debug can not be set programmaticly
  Listing3:
  Pros: Can set debug programmaticly Cons: Debug not automaticly set
  *
1. Provide the command for generating the *map* file. Which of the `gcc` tools is responsible for producing a *map* file?
  - **Answer:** *`gcc -o hello -Wl,-Map=hello.map  The linker produces the map file*
1. What is the content of each of the sections in a *map* file. Explain briefly.
  - **Answer:** *The map file contains information regarding the decisions of ld during linking*
1. Rewrite `hello.c` to produce entries in the *map* file for `.data`, `.bss`, and `.rodata`. Hint: This can be done by adding one variable for each type to the file.
  - **Answer:** *
  ```
  int datavar = 42;
  int bssvar;
  static const float rodatavar = 3.14159f;
  ```
  *
1. Add the following function to `hello.c`: `double multiply(double x1, double x2)`, which returns `x1*x2`. Use `gcc` to generate an assembly code listing for the program, and examine the assembly code. What assembly instructions are used to do this? Repeat this task, but now replace `double` with `float`. Explain!
  - **Answer:** *The assembly instructions `push, mov, sub, fld, fmul, leave, ret` are used in this function
  There was far less `mov` instructions needed to execute the float version of multiply because it uses a smaller datatype*
1. How does `make` know if a file must be recompiled?
  - **Answer:** *The make tool checks the time and date of the file to determine if it needs to be recompiled*
1. Provide a `make` command to use a file named `mymakefile` instead of the default `makefile`.
  - **Answer:** *`make -f mymakefile`*
1. How do you implement an *include guard*, and why is it needed?
  - **Answer:** *
  
  You implement the include guard with special pragma functions
  
  ```
  #ifndef EXAMPLE_H
  #define EXAMPLE_H
	// code
  #endif 
  ```
  The include guard is needed to avoid multiple inclusion problems*

##Library Task

Insert your code between the brackets `{}`:

    void main( int argc, char *argv[] )
	{
	
	int N = 0;
	int i = 0;
	
	if(argc > 1){
		int err_chk = sscanf(argv[1], "%i", &N);
		if(err_chk!=1){
			printf("Invalid Argument![SIZE]\n");
			return -1;
		}
	}else{
		printf("Needs atleast 1 Argument!\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int MIN = 0;
	int MAX = 100;

	if(argc > 2){
		int err_chk = sscanf(argv[2], "%i", &MIN);
		if(err_chk!=1){
			printf("Invalid Argument![MIN]\n");
			return -1;
		}
	}

	if(argc > 3){
		int err_chk = sscanf(argv[3], "%i", &MAX);
		if(err_chk!=1){
			printf("Invalid Argument![MAX]\n");
			return -1;
		}
	}
	
	double *list;
	list = calloc( N, sizeof(double));

	srand(time(NULL));

	for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
		double mul = (double)rand()/RAND_MAX;
		double rand_val = (MAX - MIN + 1) * mul + MIN;
		list[i] = rand_val;
	}
	
	double sum = tab_sort_sum(list, N);

	printf("Sum=%f\n",sum);
	
	for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
		printf("%i. %f\n",i,list[i]);
	}

	free(list);	

	return 0;
	
    }
    
	double tab_sort_sum( double *tab, int tab_size )
	{
	
	qsort(tab, tab_size, sizeof(double), compare);

	double sum = 0;
	int i = 0;
	
	for(i = 0; i < tab_size; i++){
		sum += tab[i];
	}

	return sum;
	}
