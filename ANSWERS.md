##Exercises from the online Unix tutorial

###Exercise 1a

Make another directory inside the `unixstuff` directory called `backups`

**Answer:** `~/unixstuff$ mkdir backups`

###Exercise 1b

Use the commands `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to explore the file system.

(Remember, if you get lost, type `cd` by itself to return to your home-directory)

**Answer:** `cd backups` `pwd` `cd ..` `ls`

###Exercise 2a

Create a backup of your `science.txt` file by copying it to a file called `science.bak`

**Answer:** `cp -T sci[tab] science.bak`

###Exercise 2b

Create a directory called `tempstuff` using `mkdir`, then remove it using the `rmdir` command.

**Answer:** `mkdir tempstuff` `rmdir tem[tab]`

###Exercise 3a

Using the above method, create another file called `list2` containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of `list2`.

**Answer:**
```
cat > list2
orange
plum
mango
grapefruit
^D
cat list2
```
###Exercise 3b

Using pipes, display all lines of `list1` and `list2` containing the letter 'p', and sort the result.

**Answer:** `grep p list1 list2 | sort` 

###Exercise 5a

Try changing access permissions on the file `science.txt` and on the directory `backups`.

Use `ls -l` to check that the permissions have changed.

**Answer:** `chmod go+rw science.txt` `chmod go-rwx backups` `ls -l`

##The C Language and Make tool Questions

1. How do you use `gcc` to only produce the `.o` file?  What is the difference between generating only the `.o` file, and building the `hello` executable done in the previous compilation above?
  - **Answer:** `gcc -c <sourcefile>` The object file is not linked
1. Give the command for compiling with `debug` enabled instead of normal compilation for the two examples shown in Listing 2 and Listing 3. Explain how to turn debugging on/off for the two cases.
  - **Answer:** Listing 2: `gcc -DDEBUG <sourcefile>`, `-g` is similar but does not define anything. *(NDEBUG may however NOT be defined) 
  Listing 3: global var `debug` must be changed in source in order to toggle.
1. Give a brief pros and cons discussion for the two methods to add debug code shown in Listing 2 and Listing 3.
  - **Answer:** Listing 2 requires compile time config but is efficient. Listing 3 can potentially be toggled during runtime but may cause efficiency reduction in tight loops regardless of mode (if self modification is not allowed/implemented)
1. Provide the command for generating the *map* file. Which of the `gcc` tools is responsible for producing a *map* file?
  - **Answer:** `-Wl,-Map=mymap.map` (`-Wl,-Map,mymap.map` for non-GNU). Arguments are passed on as linker is not part of gcc
1. What is the content of each of the sections in a *map* file. Explain briefly.
  - **Answer:** The map shows address resolutions, .data, .code, etc sections size and position, archive members included and allocated symbols and their assigned value.
1. Rewrite `hello.c` to produce entries in the *map* file for `.data`, `.bss`, and `.rodata`. Hint: This can be done by adding one variable for each type to the file.
  - **Answer:**
```
const char debug_cmt[] = "Some smart debugcomment\n";
const char hello[]     = "Hello world!\n";
const int  retval      = 0;
```
1. Add the following function to `hello.c`: `double multiply(double x1, double x2)`, which returns `x1*x2`. Use `gcc` to generate an assembly code listing for the program, and examine the assembly code. What assembly instructions are used to do this? Repeat this task, but now replace `double` with `float`. Explain!
  - **Answer:** `gcc -O -S dmult.c` (took the liberty of optimizing)
  Examining dmult.s & fmult.s: `mulsd    %xmm1, %xmm0` scalar double as opposed to `mulss    %xmm1, %xmm0` scalar single mult. instruction. Single (float) operates on half the bit-size of double. It is thus curious how gcc chooses to use the 128bit XMM registers on both accounts.
1. How does `make` know if a file must be recompiled?
  - **Answer:** The source file is 'newer' than the currently compiled file, or the file does not exist.
1. Provide a `make` command to use a file named `mymakefile` instead of the default `makefile`.
  - **Answer:** `make -f mymakefile`
1. How do you implement an *include guard*, and why is it needed?
  - **Answer:** Include guards prevent common libraries and headers being imported several times. It looks like this:
```
#ifndef IVEBEENHEREBEFORE
#define IVEBEENHEREBEFORE
// do header stuff
#endif
```
