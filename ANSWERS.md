##Exercises from the online Unix tutorial

###Exercise 1a

Make another directory inside the `unixstuff` directory called `backups`

cd unixstuff, mdir backups, (, indicates return press)

###Exercise 1b

Use the commands `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to explore the file system.

(Remember, if you get lost, type `cd` by itself to return to your home-directory)

cd NAME gets you to directory NAME, ls lists all files and directory in the current working directory, pwd shows me where i am working

###Exercise 2a

Create a backup of your `science.txt` file by copying it to a file called `science.bak`

cp science.txt science.bak

###Exercise 2b

Create a directory called `tempstuff` using `mkdir`, then remove it using the `rmdir` command.

mkdir tempstuff, rmdir tempstuff

###Exercise 3a

Using the above method, create another file called `list2` containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of `list2`.

cat > list2, orange, plum, mango, grapefruit, (ctrl+d) cat list2

###Exercise 3b

Using pipes, display all lines of `list1` and `list2` containing the letter 'p', and sort the result.

cat list1 list2 | grep p | sort

###Exercise 5a

Try changing access permissions on the file `science.txt` and on the directory `backups`.

Use `ls -l` to check that the permissions have changed.

chmod go-rwx backups, chmod a+rw science.txt
